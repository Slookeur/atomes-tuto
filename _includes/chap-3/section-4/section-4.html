<p>Adjust the shape of the slab to "<code>Cylinder</code>", in the "<code>Size</code>" options adjust the cylinder length and radius to 80 Å and 15 Å respectively. You can display the slab using the "<code>Show/Hide slab</code>" interactor, also export the results of the cutting/passivating in a new project by activating the corresponding option.<br />
Check on "<code>Passivate surface</code>" and, in the option dialog that immediately opens, and as illustrated select to passivate empty C-C bonds created when cutting the slab with water molecule.<br />

Then just click on "<code>Cut this slab now !</code>" to create a new project, that will contain the new material: a C diamond cell where the atoms inside the cylinder are removed, creating a surface, and where non-bridging bonds have been passivated using H<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O molecules.</p>
