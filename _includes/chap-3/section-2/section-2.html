<p>Adjust parameters to selected space group and corresponding settings, in this example large diamond-like crystal: Cubic, Face-centered, space group N°227 "Fd-3m (1)"<br />
Select the object(s) to be inserted at crystalline position(s), in this example C atom(s), note that in <span><strong>atomes</strong></span> it is also possible to use molecular fragments inserted from the software library or from any project opened in the workspace. If needed adjust position, and / or occupancy, then remember to select the object(s) to be actually inserted when building the crystal by clicking on "Insert". Then simply click on "<code>Build</code>".<br />

The 3D window is populated with the newly created structure, in this example a "20<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>20<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>20" supercell of pure diamond.</p>
